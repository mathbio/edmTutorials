This tutorial presents the general idea of attractor reconstruction
with synthetic data, and proposes two exercises with simulated data.
For these activities, you will need the most recent version of
[R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and the rEDM package installed in
your work computer.  To start, open R and load the package by typing
the following code in the R console:


```{r load rEDM, echo=TRUE}
library(rEDM)
```


Before you proceed please read through the essential concepts by
reading the introduction and the first section (*"Empirical Dynamic
Modelling"*) of rEDM's tutorial that you can find
[here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rEDM/vignettes/rEDM-tutorial.html)
or in your local R installation with the command


```{r call vignette, eval=FALSE}
vignette("rEDM-tutorial", package="rEDM")
```

# A simple case: harmonic oscillator

Let's get the grips with R language and to figure out how to
reconstruct a state space with only one time series and its lags.  For
the first example, we use a very well-known system and its
representation on state space, the harmonic oscillator:


$\frac{dx}{dt}=y$

$\frac{dy}{dt}=-x$

which has the solution $x(t)=A \sin(t), \ y(t)=A \cos(t)$, so we can
draw the state space of this system by laying down in two Cartesian
axis its two state variables, $x(t)$ and $y(t)$. The attractors of
this system are circles, that is, all possible trajectories of a
solution form a circle in the state space:

```{r generates data for the harmonic oscillator, echo=TRUE}
## Generate the data at tau = 0.2 time intervals
time1<-seq(0, 500, by = 0.2) 
x1<-sin(time1)
y1<-cos(time1)
## Plot the state space
plot(x1, y1, type = 'l', main = "State-space of harmonic oscillator",
     cex=0.2, xlab="X(t)", ylab="Y(t)")
```

And here are the time series for the two state variables:

```{r time series of each variable}
## Time series of the 1st 250 observations
ind <- 1:250
plot(time1[ind], x1[ind], type = 'l',
     main = "Time series of the variables of the system",
     col = "red", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Amplitude",
     ylim=c(-1,1.25))
lines(time1[ind], y1[ind], col = "blue")
legend("topright", c("X","Y"), col=c("red", "blue"),
       lty=1, bty="n")
```

## A reconstruction of the state space

Now suppose that all the information you have about this system is a
time series of one of the state variables, say $X(t)$.  Because $Y(t)$
is missing, we are not able to construct a state space as we see
above, but Takens theorem tells us that we can do a reconstruction of
the state space that recovers the information of the original state
space. This **state space reconstruction** creates an **embedding** of
a **shadow manifold** of the atractor.  So we can define the shadow
manifold as a valid topological reconstruction of the attractor.


To do a state space reconstruction we create new variables by lagging
the time series by multiples of a time interval $\tau$. In this case
we will use the interval between observations ($\tau=0.2$ time units).
The R commands below create a data table object (which is called a
*data frame* in R) with the original time series and its lagged
version. The handy function `make_block` by the rEDM authors does this
job. Use this command to download the function code and load it in
your R workspace (the function will be included in the rEDM package in
future releases):

```{r load make_block, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mathbio/edmTutorials/master/utilities/make_block.R")
```

And now you can create a data frame with the original and lagged 
series of data:


```{r plot one time series alone}
## Data frame with observations with tau = 0.2 with one lag
df1 <- make_block(data.frame(x=x1), t=time1, max_lag = 2)
```

The most important arguments of this function are `max_lag` and `tau`;
check the help page of this function (`help(make_tutorial)`) for more
details.  Anyway, a quick look at the first and last lines of the data
frame can help to understand the lagged variable structure created by
`make_block`:


```{r check lagged data frame}
## Take a look in the lagged data to understand how the function works
head(df1)
tail(df1)
```

By plotting the time series
as a function of their lagged versions we get the
shadow manifold, which in is this bi-dimensional 
case is easy to see:

```{r shadow manifold}
plot(x_1 ~ x, data=df1, type="l",
     xlab = "X", ylab = "X(t + tau)" )
```

As expected, the shadow is similar to the attractor.
In fact this similarity is well defined in topological
terms. A key property of a valid shadow manifold 
is that it is a one-to-one map of the attractor.

But a shadow manifold will only be valid in this sense if it is
embedded in the correct number of dimensions.  There is an optimal
number of dimensions to build a valid state space reconstruction,
which we call the **embedding dimension** of an manifold.  In this
simple case we obviously need two dimensions.  Takens' Theorem gives
us an upper limit - it guarantees that the number of dimensions is up
to 2D + 1, where D is the dimensionality of the attractor. Finding the
optimal embedding dimension is part of a vast topic called
*Embedology* (Sauer *et al.* 1991), and the package `rEDM` provide
some methods to do this.  We will learn more abou this in the
following tutorials of this course.


# Noisy data

How robust is the attractor reconstruction to random noise?  There are
two main types of noise or error in data, which we call **process
errors** and **observational errors**. The first one is about random
changes of the state variables, like environmental fluctuations that
affect the dynamic. The second type of error is related to measurement
error in the data, for instance when we miss individuals of some
species when counting them, or have limited precision (inherent to all
measurement).  Observational errors do not affect the dynamics, only
the portrait we make of it.

In this section, we check how robust the attractor is to measurement
error by adding simulated noise to the original time series.  Use the
commands below to simulate that the time series has independent
measurement errors with constant variance.  To do this, we add to each
observation a value drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean
and standard deviation which is 1/12 of the standard deviation of the
time series itself.


```{r plot one 2nd time series alone}
## a new vector of observed values + Gaussian iid error
x2 <- x1 + rnorm(n = length(x1), mean = 0, sd = sd(x1)/12)
## Time series
plot(x1[ind] ~ time1[ind], type="l", xlab = "Time", ylab = "X",
     col="grey", lwd = 5, ylim=range(x2))
lines(x2[ind] ~ time1[ind], type="l", col="red", lwd=2)
```

We thus proceed by creating a new data frame with the 
lagged variables with noise and by plotting the new shadow manifold:

```{r 2D plot noisy series}
## Data frame with lagged variables
df2 <- make_block( data.frame(x = x2))
## Shadow manifold with embedding = 2
plot(x_1 ~ x, data=df2, type="l",
     ylab = "X(t + tau)", xlab = "X" , col="grey",
     lwd=0.5)
```

In this case the shadow manifold still looks like the 
original shape of the attractor, despite the noise caused by measurement errors.

## Increasing the noise

Measurement errors make attractors more complex by spreading
points (and thus trajectories) over the state space. 
Hence, the trajectories may cross in the shadow manifold,
which breaks down the one-to-one mapping to the original attractor.
Of course this effect gets larger as we increase the measurement
error. We now will investigate a bit more how this affects
the attractor reconstruction.
The commands below double the measurement error of the time series
and plots the shadow manifold:

```{r more noise}
x3 <- x1 + rnorm(n = length(x1), mean = 0, sd = sd(x1)/6)
df3 <- make_block(data.frame(x=x3), max_lag = 5)
plot(x_1 ~ x, data=df3, type="l", col="grey", lwd=0.5,
     ylab = "X(t + tau)", xlab = "X" )
```


The attractor reconstruction looks worse now, but we can overcome this
problem by adding more dimensions to the state space reconstruction. 
By doing this we unfold the shadow manifold, by
unfolding crossing trajectories.
We do this adding more axes, that correspond to 
the time series lagged by the further time steps 
($t + \tau, \ t + 2\tau, \ t + 3\tau \dots$).


You can check with the interactive plot below
how an additional dimension unfolds a bit more the shadow manifold. [^1]
In the following days we will learn some methods to find
the optimal dimension of the state space reconstruction. By now the take-home message
is: the more **complex** the attractor, or the larger the **error** (observational or not), the more dimensions you
will need to make a good reconstruction.


```{r more noise 3D plot, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
plot_ly(df3, x = ~x, y=~x_1, z=~x_2, type="scatter3d",
        mode="lines", opacity=0.25) %>%
    layout(scene=list(camera = list(eye = list(x = 0, y = 0, z = -2)),
                      xaxis = list(title = 'X'),
                      yaxis = list(title = 'X (t + tau)'),
                      zaxis = list(title = 'X (t + 2tau)')))
```

# Exercises

## What is the effect of sampling interval?

The commands below simulate a new time series of the bi-dimensional
harmonic oscillator without measurement
error but with a much smaller interval between observations 
(0.01 time units). 


```{r simulates oscillator series with smaller sampling }
time4<-seq(0, 500, by = 0.01) 
x4<-sin(time4)
y4<-cos(time4)
```

This change of the sampling frequency affects the shape of the reconstruction:

```{r smaller sampling interval manifold}
df4 <- make_block(data.frame(x=x4), t=time4)
plot(x_1 ~ x, data=df4, type="l",
     xlab = "X", ylab = "X(t + tau)" )
```

How do you explain that? Which practical issues does this fact bring
and how to solve them?

### Hints

**1.** The command below adds a line $X(t) = X(t + \tau)$ to the state space reconstruction, 
which can help you to understand the problem with small values of $\tau$:

```{r abline, eval=FALSE}
abline(0,1, col="red")
```

## Attractor reconstruction

In this exercise you have to
reconstruct the state space of a time series in this, 
checking if a three-dimensional plot
improve the reconstruction.
To load the data in R run the command:

```{r problem time series}
prob2 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mathbio/edmTutorials/master/takens/problem-time-series.csv")
```
To take a look in the time series plot run:

```{r plot time series problem 2}
plot( X ~ time, data = prob2, type="l")
```

### Hints

**1.** Recall from the previous problem that 
the sampling interval changes the shape of the shadow manifold. Using
models, you control this sampling frequency; usually not so with
data. Then you can only vary $\tau$, which is by how many time steps
each variable is lagged.  For details see the help page of the
`make_block` function.

**2.** To create a simple 3D plot in R you can use the 
`scatterplot3d` package. The example below 
does this for one of the noisy
time series we examined above:


```{r 3D plot with scatterplot3d}
## Loads the package
library(scatterplot3d)
## 3D plot
scatterplot3d(x = df2$x, y = df2$x_1, z = df2$x_2,
              type = "l", color="grey", lwd = 0.5,
              xlab = "x(t)", ylab = "x(t+tau)", zlab = "x(t + 2 tau)")
```

If the package is not available in your local R installation
you can install it with:


```{r install packages, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("scatterplot3d")
```
