# EDM Readings and Resources recommended by George Sugihara

## I. Summary Readings:

- Causation: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/338/6106/496.full?keytype=ref&siteid=sci&ijkey=GzlL9h2cAY51A

- Model-free: http://www.wired.com/2015/10/is-it-foolish-to-model-natures-complexity-with-equations/

- PNAS Commentary: http://www.pnas.org/content/112/13/3856.short

## II.Essential Resource:

The rEDM package on CRAN is a key resource that contains a tutorial that
many have found useful. It consists of code and vignettes with data that
will help implementing EDM analysis.
