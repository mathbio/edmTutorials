* **Attractor**: the set of points to which the trajectories of a
  dynamical system converges over time.
  
* **Lagged-variable plot**: a plot of a time series in function of 
the same time series lagged by a multiples of a time value $\tau$.
A three-dimensional lagged variable plot will thus have in its axes
the original time series $X(t)$ , the lagged time series $X(t + \tau)$
and $X(t + 2\tau)$.

* **State-space reconstruction**: the process of making a 
representation of a state-space of interest that preserves its
important properties. We will use this term also to refer to the
lagged coordinate plot of a time series, which do the task of
reconstructing the original state-space. 

* **Shadow Manifold**: the projection of the original manifold (which
  is an attractor in our case) into an Euclidian space. This space has
  a dimension (the embedding dimension) that ensures a one-to-one map to the
  original manifold. 

* **Embedding dimension**: for our purposes the dimension of the
Euclidian space used to build the shadow manifold. In the case of a state space
reconstruction, the embedding dimension is the dimension of this
space, that is, the number of axes of the lagged-variable plot.
