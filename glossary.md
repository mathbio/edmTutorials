* **Lagged-variable plot**: a plot of a time series in function of 
the same time series lagged by a multiples of a time value $\tau$.
A three-dimensional lagged variable plot will thus have in its axes
the original time series $X(t)$ , the lagged time series $X(t + \tau)$
and $X(t + 2\tau)$.

* **State-space reconstruction**: the process of making a valid 
representation of a state-space of interest. 
We will use this term also to refer to the lagged coordinate plot of a time series, 
which do the task of reconstructing the original state-space.

* **Embedding**: a representation of a topological object in a Euclidian space in such 
a way that its properties are preserved.

* **Embedding dimension**: the dimensionality of the Euclidian space used to represent a topological
object. In the case of a state space reconstruction, the embedding dimension is the dimensionality
of this space, that is, the number of axes of the lagged-variable plot.

* **Shadow Manifold**: the projection of the original manifold (an attractor in our case) into an euclidian space. 
A valid shadow manifold has an embbeding that ensures a one-to-one map to the original manifold.
